Welcome to ChefHelper!

Chefhelper is a recipe and kitchen inventory app that allows you to keep track of what's in your kitchen and allows you to share recipes with other Chefhelper users.

The goal of Chefhelper is to create a matching algorithm that assesses what you have in your kitchen and recommends recipes that match the ingredients you have available. For now it is simply a double sided data management system.

Clone, run bundle, run shotgun, and enjoy!
